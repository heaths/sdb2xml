# Shim Database to XML Converter

Windows Application Capability uses databases to look for and apply shims to application files, install packages, and more.

This is a port of the [application](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/setup/shim-database-to-xml/) I originally wrote for discovering what shims were applied to Windows Installer packages. The source code was lost but seems people still find this handy, and there's some improvements I would like to make to modernize it.

For usage information, run `sdb2xml -h`.
